Biotic Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Biotic ,"The Biotic Component (BC) of CMECS is a classification of the living organisms of the seabed and water column together with their physical associations at a variety of spatial scales. The BC is organized into a branched hierarchy of five nested levels: biotic setting, biotic class, biotic subclass, biotic group, and biotic community (Table 8.1). The biotic setting indicates whether the biota are attached or closely associated with the benthos or are suspended or floating in the water column. Biotic classes and biotic subclasses describe major biological characteristics at a fairly coarse level. Biotic groups are descriptive terms based on finer distinctions of taxonomy, structure, position, environment, and salinity levels. Biotic communities are descriptions of repeatable, characteristic assemblages of organisms. In the absence of complete species association data, biotic communities can be approximated using dominant or diagnostic species and then refined once more information is available. When identified in the context of repeating environmental circumstances, biotic communities can be used as the basis for defining and fully describing biotopes. A biotope assigns a more complete description of the feature; involving all other applicable components of CMECS, listing the defining species and explaining the ecological and societal values of the biotope (see Section 9).
Unless otherwise noted, biotic classification units in the BC are defined by the dominance of life forms, taxa, or other classifiers in an observation. For collected observations (such as grab samples or cores), dominance is measured in terms of biomass or numbers of individuals, as specified by the user. In the case of images and visual estimates, dominance is assigned to the taxa with the greatest percent cover in the observational footprint. For example, an observation with 60% seagrass, 20% soft corals, and 20% sponges is classified as an Aquatic Vegetation Bed—whereas an observation with 60% soft corals, 20% seagrass, and 20% sponges is classified as a Faunal Bed. It may be important for some users to note the presence of the non-dominant biota, which can be achieved by using a Co-occurring Element in an observation. See Section 10 for information about how to note Co-occurring Elements and Associated Taxa.",2012-06,B,
Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Setting,"Planktonic Biota includes biota that drift, float, or remain suspended in the water column in aggregations that are big enough to be (a) detected by the human eye (or with mild magnification) or (b) sampled with a fine-plankton net. Planktonic biota are not regularly associated with the seafloor. Water parcels may be examined for plankton using a dipnet, a water sampler, a towed plankton net, imagery (including ""Plankton Cameras"" that are moved through the water), or other means. In all cases, plankton are assigned classifications based on perceived dominance by the observer (either based on mass or numbers, as specified by the user/observer). Because most plankton communities are mixes of many types of zooplankton and phytoplankton, practitioners should consider the widespread use of the Co-occurring Elements modifier (when non-dominant taxa are covered in other parts of the CMECS classification) or the Associated Taxa modifier (when non-dominant taxa do not constitute a CMECS classification unit).",2012-06,B,1
Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,Zooplankton,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Class,"Water parcels or layers in which zooplankton are perceived to be the dominant feature. Zooplankton are heterotrophic biota of the water column; zooplankton drift with the currents, but may (or may not) be able to move through the water under their own power. Zooplankton may feed on phytoplankton, other zooplankton, or on detritus. CMECS classifies zooplankton that may range in size from gigantic salp chains (strings of gelatinous filter feeding tunicates that attain a length of 30 meters or more), to radiolarians (minute, shelled amoebas). CMECS was not designed to be used for the smallest planktonic forms (nanoplankton or picoplankton). CMECS Class Zooplankton includes both Holoplankton (that live out their entire life histories in the plankton) and Meroplankton (that are transient in the plankton). Meroplankton are typically larval stages that develop into nekton or benthos as they mature. Meroplankton in general are difficult to identify; specialized taxonomic knowledge and sets of regional keys are generally required. Both Holoplankton and Meroplankton are quite diverse and include members of most marine phyla.

Aggregations of specific types of zooplankton (or of mixed zooplankton/phytoplankton communities) may occur in many forms. In general, an ""Aggregation"" is a relatively dense and homogeneous group of plankton that may be produced by rapid reproduction in-place under favorable conditions (by phytoplankton and holoplankton), by hydrodynamic forcing, by a common mass origin, by plankton motility (e.g., diurnal vertical migrations), by barriers to movement (e.g., pycnoclines), or by other phenomena. A Spawning Aggregation forms after a mass spawning event when synchronous spawning by many individuals produces large pulses of gametes and larvae. Classification of a Spawning Aggregation requires some evidence of recent mass spawning. Aggregations of all types may occur as amorphously shaped packets of water, may occur in layers at various depths, and may occur as diurnal migrations, among other forms.",2012-06,B,1.1

Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,Phytoplankton,Cryptophyte Phytoplankton,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Water parcels or layers in which zooplankton are perceived to be the dominant feature. Zooplankton are heterotrophic biota of the water column; zooplankton drift with the currents, but may (or may not) be able to move through the water under their own power. Zooplankton may feed on phytoplankton, other zooplankton, or on detritus. CMECS classifies zooplankton that may range in size from gigantic salp chains (strings of gelatinous filter feeding tunicates that attain a length of 30 meters or more), to radiolarians (minute, shelled amoebas). CMECS was not designed to be used for the smallest planktonic forms (nanoplankton or picoplankton). CMECS Class Zooplankton includes both Holoplankton (that live out their entire life histories in the plankton) and Meroplankton (that are transient in the plankton). Meroplankton are typically larval stages that develop into nekton or benthos as they mature. Meroplankton in general are difficult to identify; specialized taxonomic knowledge and sets of regional keys are generally required. Both Holoplankton and Meroplankton are quite diverse and include members of most marine phyla.

Aggregations of specific types of zooplankton (or of mixed zooplankton/phytoplankton communities) may occur in many forms. In general, an ""Aggregation"" is a relatively dense and homogeneous group of plankton that may be produced by rapid reproduction in-place under favorable conditions (by phytoplankton and holoplankton), by hydrodynamic forcing, by a common mass origin, by plankton motility (e.g., diurnal vertical migrations), by barriers to movement (e.g., pycnoclines), or by other phenomena. A Spawning Aggregation forms after a mass spawning event when synchronous spawning by many individuals produces large pulses of gametes and larvae. Classification of a Spawning Aggregation requires some evidence of recent mass spawning. Aggregations of all types may occur as amorphously shaped packets of water, may occur in layers at various depths, and may occur as diurnal migrations, among other forms.",2012-06,B,1.3.4

The concentration of microbes creates numerous niches for feeding by higher trophic levels and for the processing of biogenic and inorganic compounds that are important to marine chemistry, including controlling carbon, nitrogen and sulfur redox processes (Hansel and Francis 2006).

Sea foam is the foam the lies on the sea surface, in the surf zone and at times on intertidal areas, created from dissolved organic compounds when air is forcefully injected into the water column (Harden and Williams 1989). Foam formation is aided by properties of lignans, proteins and carbohydrates that act as surfactants or foaming agents. The large area presented by the micro-bubbles composing seafoam is an ideal surface for concentration and adherence of microbial communities including bacteria, viruses and microscopic plankton. The characteristics of the air-water interface, and particularly of sea foam are unique compared to the bulk water column (Lion and Leckie 1981) and possess unique physical and chemical properties. The foams are well-oxygenated, sites of photolytic processes and tend to support high levels of aerobic metabolism with high organic processing rates. Surface foam is the site of intense trophic activity at the microbial level because of the concentration of microbial biomass, sugars, lipids and other growth compounds and thus represents an important part of the marine microbial food web. Concentration and transformation of trace metals, nutrient compounds, contaminants and pollutants also occurs in sea foam and can enter the food web via microbial pathways.

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Class,"Seabeds dominated or characterized by a cover of animals that are closely associated with the bottom, including attached, clinging, sessile, infaunal, burrowing, laying, interstitial, and slow-moving animals, but not animals that have created substrate (Reef Biota). Unlike Reef Biota, Faunal Bed biota cannot (or are not sufficiently abundant to) construct identifiable substrate. ""Slow-moving"" animals included in the Faunal Bed class are defined as being incapable of moving outside the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Faunal Bed organisms are aquatic, but they may be able to withstand periods of exposure to air.
Faunal Bed food webs may receive basic trophic inputs from benthic photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, plankton, allochthonous detritus and debris, or other sources. In nature, Faunal Bed habitats are often composed of complex mixes and associations of animals of different phyla, sizes, feeding strategies, and habits, and these areas can be difficult to classify. Faunal Bed classifications are determined in CMECS by greatest percent cover of fauna or faunal structures, or (particularly for infauna) by estimates of greatest biomass. The inherent complexity of these areas is addressed through Co-occurring Elements and Associated Taxa Modifiers (Sections 10.6.2 and 10.3.1).
In the photic zone, primary producers often constitute the greatest biotic percent cover of substrate, and so define the biotic group of an area (e.g., Filamentous Algal Bed, Microphytobenthos). Faunal Bed organisms, when present in these areas, are classified in CMECS as Co-occurring Elements, for example: ""Biotic Group: Coralline/Crustose Algal Bed with Co-occurring Element: <Strongylocentrotus purpurata>"".
In waters deeper than the photic zone, however, most Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by immobile or slow-moving suspension-feeders and detritivores that dominate percent cover or biomass, and create a distinct living environment for other fauna. Other Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by slow-moving grazers or predators (e.g., urchins, starfish), when these are the clearly dominant fauna. However, practitioners should attempt to identify a biotic group that is providing ""forage"" for these predatory or herbivorous species. If a ""forage"" biotope is present, it will often dominate percent cover, and practitioners should characterize the area accordingly as (for example): ""Biotic Community: Nassariid Bed with Co-occurring Element: <Pisaster>"". The Co-occurring Elements modifier (see Section 10.6.2) is used to describe areas where any two (or more) biotic groups, biotic communities, or other biotic classification units described in CMECS occur simultaneously. In these cases, the classification units exist together, as a mix, in a single location, and the non-dominant units are termed Co-occurring Elements. Further local research may indicate that the mix of biotic groups and co-occurring elements is, in fact, a repeatable unit that should be designated as a single defined biotic group or biotope.
Other common animals in seafloor environments include opportunistic predators or herbivores that are capable of moving outside the bounds of the classification unit within one day, such as portunid crabs, cancrid crabs, horseshoe crabs, cephalopods, other mobile benthic crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton. These animals actively move over the seafloor searching for prey, and are defined in CMECS as Associated Taxa (see Section 10.3.1).
As in other BC classes, practitioners may apply Genus and/or species names to define local biotic communities that are not listed in the current version of CMECS. In these cases, observations in the field must verify that these new biotic communities are predictable and repeating aggregations or assemblages of dominant or characteristic species. These names should be submitted as part of the CMECS Dynamic Content Standard (see Section 13).",2012-06,B,2.2
Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,Attached Fauna,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Areas characterized by rock substrates, gravel substrates, other hard substrates, or mixed substrates that are dominated by fauna which maintain contact with the substrate surface, including firmly attached, crawling, resting, interstitial, or clinging fauna. Fauna may be found on, between, or under rocks or other hard substrates or substrate mixes. These fauna use pedal discs, cement, byssal threads, feet, claws, appendages, spines, suction, negative density, or other means to stay in contact with the (generally) hard substrate, and may or may not be capable of slow movement over the substrate. However, these fauna are not able to achieve speeds sufficient to move beyond the unit boundary within one day. Many attached fauna are suspension feeders and feed from the water column. Other attached fauna are benthic feeders, including herbivores, predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Within Attached Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover on the hard attachment surface within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1).",2012-06,B,2.2.1

Many sea urchins are omnivorous, consuming algae, debris, sessile invertebrates, and other foods. In some situations, sea urchins will occur in great numbers, clearly constituting the dominant Biotic Group.

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,Soft Sediment Fauna,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Areas that are characterized by fine unconsolidated substrates (sand, mud) and that are dominated in percent cover or in estimated biomass by infauna, sessile epifauna, mobile epifauna, mobile fauna that create semi-permanent burrows as homes, or by structures or evidence associated with these fauna (e.g., tilefish burrows, lobster burrows). These animals may tunnel freely within the sediment or embed themselves wholly or partially in the sediment. In many cases, they will regularly leave their burrows, and may move rapidly or swim actively after doing so, but any animal that creates a semi-permanent home in the sediment can be classified as Soft Sediment Fauna. These animals may also move slowly over the sediment surface, but are not capable of moving outside of the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Most of these fauna possess specialized organs for burrowing, digging, embedding, tube-building, anchoring, or locomotory activities in soft substrates. Biotic communities in the Soft Sediment Fauna subclass are identified with the term ""Bed"", to distinguish them from Attached Fauna biotic communities (which do not include the term ""Bed"").
Within Soft Sediment Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover or the greatest estimated biomass within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover or estimated biomass values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) as Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1). Associated Taxa include rapid epifaunal predators such as crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton that are capable of leaving the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Associated Taxa may be capable of digging into the sediment surface to feed or hide (e.g., portunid crabs) but do not construct a semi-permanent burrow as would define Soft Sediment Fauna. For practitioners who wish to better characterize Soft Sediment Fauna, the Community Successional Stage Modifier (Section 10.3.2, including Figure 10.1 and Table 10.3) is a helpful addition to classifying soft sediment fauna, and can be applied to almost every soft-sediment area. This modifier provides ecological and functional information, and adds an element of assessment.",2012-06,B,2.2.2

Diverse mixes of fauna are common, and biotic communities may or may not be identifiable with an abundant or distinctive dominant taxon. Large fecal casts, mounds, burrows, feeding voids, etc., may be taken as evidence of deep-burrowing fauna. However, areas characterized by larger, tube-building worms (that construct a significant tube structure rising above the sediment-water interface, but may live with a body position below the sediment surface) are classified as Larger Tube-Building Fauna.

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Aquatic Vegetation Bed,Benthic Macroalgae,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Aquatic beds dominated by macroalgae attached to the substrate, such as kelp (Figure 8.14), intertidal fucoids, and calcareous algae. Macroalgal communities can exist at all depths within the photic zone, on diverse substrates, and across a range of energy and water chemistry regimes. In the CMECS framework, macroalgae that dominate the benthic environment and form a vegetated cover fall within this subclass. Macroalgal communities (typically coralline/crustose algae) that build substrate in a reef setting are categorized in the BC Reef Biota Class instead.
Many macroalgal types and communities have low temporal persistence and can bloom and die-back within short periods. This aspect of macroalgae is reflected with the temporal persistence modifier, which allows further description of the units in this subclass.
While many researchers organize macroalgae based on their pigmentation, CMECS takes a growth morphology approach to defining benthic algal biotic groups. This decision was driven by the fact that macroalgal assemblages often include a variety of co-existing algal species, making delineations of individual species difficult. This approach also captures the influence that the algal growth structure has in shaping the local environment- by providing shelter, shade, and detrital material to an area, which is important to associated fauna.
The Biotic Group level of classification here is a modification of the ""Littler functional-form model"" for marine macroalgae, as described by Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) and promoted by Lobban and Harrison (1997). The Littler functional form groups are the sheet group, filamentous group, coarsely branched group, thick leathery group, jointed calcareous group, and crustose group. Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) discuss the morphological, metabolic, and ecological significance of each group, and they point out that these groups are best considered as recognizable points along a continuum (rather than as discrete bins). Biotic Groups and Communities defined by macroalgae generally also include a diversity of associated fauna, including many that consume macroalgae (e.g., sea urchins and mollusks); these may be characterized as Modifiers: Associated Taxa, or Co-occurring Elements.",2012-06,B,2.5.1

However, FGDC-STD-005-2008 does not split marshes into ""herbaceous"" or ""scrub-shrub"" at their Group level. As a result, some of the names of FGDC-STD-005-2008 types (which correspond to the CMECS Emergent Wetland class) indicate that the biotic community is a ""Dwarf-shrubland."" These specific communities are dominated by woody forbs, which- while technically dwarf-shrubs- function more like herbaceous vegetation. These types were included in Emergent Tidal Marsh, because their total floristics and physiognomy indicate an herbaceous marsh setting.

Vegetation in this subclass is composed of emergent aquatic macrophytes, especially halophytic species- chiefly graminoids (such as rushes, reeds, grasses and sedges), shrubs, and other herbaceous species (such as broad-leaved emergent macrophytes, rooted floating-leaved and submergent species [aquatic vegetation], and macroscopic algae). The vegetation is usually arranged in distinct zones of parallel patterns, which occur in response to gradients of tidal flooding frequency and duration, water chemistry, or other disturbances.

Tides may expose mudflats that contain a sparse mix of pioneering forb and graminoid species. Salinity levels (which control many aspects of salt-marsh chemistry) vary depending on a complexity of factors, including frequency of inundation, rainfall, soil texture, freshwater influence, fossil salt deposits, and more. Salt marshes often grade into (or are intermixed with) scrub-shrub wetlands in higher areas. See Figure 8.16 for an example of an emergent tidal marsh.",2012-06,B,2.6.1

Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group.

Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs.
