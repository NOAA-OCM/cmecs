Geoform Component,,,,,CMECS Component: Geoform ,"In CMECS, the geological context—and associated features of the landscape and seascape—are captured in the Geoform Component (GC), which describes the physical structure of the environment across multiple scales. The GC addresses five aspects of the coastal and seafloor morphology: tectonic setting, physiographic setting, geoform origin, geoform, and geoform type. The framework for the GC adopts most of the structures described by Greene et al. (2007) and the estuary types outlined in Madden et al. (2008), but expands the options to include a larger number of coastal and nearshore features.
The GC is not intended to be a geological classification per se. Rather, it provides a way to present the structural aspects of the physical environment that are relevant to—and drivers of—biological community distribution. This component does not include surface geology attributes [such as hardbottom, softbottom, sand, gravel, and cobble as in Greene et al. (2007)], because these attributes are included in the Substrate Component that describes the character and composition of the seafloor. Used together, geoform and substrate component units reflect the physical environment in which benthic/attached biota occurs.
The GC is organized into four subcomponents that occur along a spatial continuum (Table 6.1): tectonic setting and physiographic setting describe large, global features, while the level 1 and level 2 geoform subcomponents describe meso-and microscale units (extending down to features at the meter scale). Each subcomponent has a general scale range associated with it, but features within these categories will naturally overlap one another—because of the natural gradients and transitions between geologic units and processes. Similarly, regional differences in processes will cause units to respond differently on spatial and temporal scales (Harris et al. 2005).",2012-06,G,
Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting ,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"At the largest scales, the GC is divided into eight planetary features that reflect global tectonic processes (both past and present). Generally, these features are thousands of square kilometers or larger in size. They include both continental and oceanic crustal units, and the tectonic setting features form the context for all of the smaller-scale geoforms.",2012-06,G,t
Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Abyssal Plain,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A flat region of the deep ocean floor (with a slope less than 1:1,000) that was formed by the deposition of pelagic and gravity-current sediments, which obscure the pre-existing topography.

Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Convergent Active Continental Margin,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Intense areas of active magmatism, where the oceanic lithosphere is subducted beneath the continental lithosphere.

Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Mid-Ocean Ridge,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"An extremely large, global spreading center. The mid-ocean ridge is a continuous, seismically active, median mountain range extending through the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, and South Pacific Oceans. It is a broad, fractured swell with a central rift valley and usually extremely rugged topography. The ridge is 1-3 kilometers in height, about 1,500 kilometers in width, and over 84,000 kilometers in length.

Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Transform Continental Margin,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,A feature defined by the transform fault that develops during continental rifting.

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"Spatially nested within the tectonic settings, physiographic settings describe landscape-level geomorphological features from the coast to mid-ocean spreading centers. These large features—generally on the scale of hundreds of square kilometers—can cross tectonic settings, and they can be delineated at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (or greater) using bathymetric maps and other remote sensing data. Each setting will normally contain a wide variety of the smaller geoform features.",2012-06,G,p

Abyssal fans form at the mouths of submarine canyons, and fans are also the result of turbidities (that is, gravity-driven, underwater avalanches).",2012-06,G,p1
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Barrier Reef,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A long, narrow coral reef, roughly parallel to the shore and separated from it by a lagoon of considerable depth and width. This reef may enclose a volcanic island (either wholly or in part), or it may lie a great distance from a continental coast (such as the Great Barrier Reef).

Three principle examples of this type of feature are Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the New Caledonia Barrier Reef, and the Meso-American Barrier Reef system- although similar features exist elsewhere.",2012-06,G,p2
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Bight,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A broad bend or curve in a generally open coast. Examples include the South Atlantic Bight and the Southern California Bight.

The rise is a gentle incline (with slopes of 0.5° to 1°) and it has generally smooth topography- although it may bear submarine canyons.,2012-06,G,p5
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Continental/Island Shelf,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"That part of the continental margin that is between the shoreline and the continental slope (or a depth or 200 meters when there is no noticeable continental slope); it is characterized by its very gentle slope of 0.1°. Island shelves are analogous to the continental shelves, but surround islands.",2012-06,G,p6
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Continental/Island Shore Complex,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This feature includes the land-water interface zone and contains geoforms across a diversity of scales.

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Continental/Island Slope,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"That part of the continental margin that is between the continental shelf and the continental rise (if there is one); it is characterized by its relatively steep slope of 1.5 - 6°.

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Embayment/Bay,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A water body with some level of enclosure by land at different spatial scales.

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Fjord,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A long, narrow, glacially eroded inlet or arm of the sea. They are often U-shaped, steep-walled, and deep. Because of their depth, they tend to have low surface-area-to-volume ratios. They have moderate watershed-to-water-area ratios and low-to-moderate riverine inputs. Fjords often have a geologic sill formation at the seaward end caused by glacial action. This morphology- combined with a low exchange of bottom waters with the ocean- can result in formation of hypoxic bottom waters.",2012-06,G,p10
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Inland/Enclosed Sea,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A large, water body almost completely surrounded by land. Salinities range from fresh through marine. The term inland is used to describe situations where the water body is connected to an adjacent large water body by a narrow strait, channel, canal, or river. Examples of this type of setting are the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The Great Lakes, due to their connectivity to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River also fall into this category.",2012-06,G,p11
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Lagoonal Estuary,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be shallow, highly enclosed, and have reduced exchange with the ocean. They often experience high evaporation, and they tend to be quiescent in terms of wind, current, and wave energy. Lagoonal estuaries usually have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, a low-to-moderate watershed-to-water-area ratio, and can have a high wetland-to-water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and embayments because the restricted exchange with the marine-end member and the reduced river input lengthen residence times. As such, there tends to be more benthic-pelagic interaction, enhanced by generally shallow bathymetry. Additionally, exchange with surrounding landscapes (often riparian wetland and palustrine systems) tends to be enhanced and more highly coupled than in other types of estuaries.

Occasionally, a lagoon may be produced by the temporary sealing of a river estuary by a barrier. Such lagoons are usually seasonal and exist until the river breaches the barrier; these lagoons occur in regions of low or sporadic rainfall.",2012-06,G,p12
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Major River Delta,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"The nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at the mouth of a river, which commonly forms a triangular or fan-shaped plain. It is crossed by many distributaries, and the delta is the result of sediment accumulation from the river. Deltas are distinguished from alluvial fans by their flatter slope. Examples of this feature include the Mississippi Delta, the Nile Delta, and the Ganges Delta. All deltas are dynamic areas of mixed-water flow and salinity.",2012-06,G,p13
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Marine Basin Floor,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Basin floors refer broadly to the areas of the seafloor between the base of the continental margin (usually the foot of the continental rise) and the mid-ocean ridge. Occasionally, this large region is subdivided into smaller basins based on local bathymetry.",2012-06,G,p14
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Ocean Bank/Plateau,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A mound-like or ridge-like elevated area on the seafloor; it may have a modest-to-substantial extent. Although submerged, this feature can reach close to sea level (e.g., Bahama Banks).",2012-06,G,p15
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Riverine Estuary,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be linear and seasonally turbid (especially in upper reaches), and it can be subjected to high current speeds. These estuaries are sedimentary and depositional, so they may be associated with a delta, bar, barrier island, and other depositional features. These estuaries also tend to be highly flushed (with a wide and variable salinity range) and seasonally stratified. Riverine estuaries have moderate surface-to-volume ratios with a high watershed-to-water-area ratio- and they can have very high wetland-to-water-area ratios as well. These estuaries are often characterized by a V-shaped channel configuration and a salt wedge.

High inputs of land drainage can promote increased primary productivity, which may be confined to the water column in the upper reach, due to low transparency in the water column. Surrounding wetlands may be extensive and healthy, given the sediment supply and nutrient input. This marsh perimeter may be important in taking up the excess nutrients that are introduced to the system. Physically, the system may tend to be stratified during periods of high riverine input, and the input of marine waters may be enhanced by countercurrent flow.",2012-06,G,p16

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Sound,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"(a) A relatively long, narrow waterway connecting two larger bodies of water (or two parts of the same water body), or an arm of the sea forming a channel between the mainland and an island (e.g., Puget Sound, WA). A sound is generally wider and more extensive than a strait.

These canyons can be associated with terrestrial or nearshore river inputs, such as in the Hudson or Mississippi canyons.",2012-06,G,p20
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Trench,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Trenches in the physiographic setting subcomponent occur at a smaller spatial scale than the hemispheric-sized trenches in the tectonic setting. Both types of trenches share similar morphology, but physiographic setting Trenches are not necessarily associated with plate subduction.",2012-06,G,p21
Geoform Component,Geoform,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"Geoforms are physical, coastal and seafloor structures that are generally no larger than hundreds of square kilometers in size. This size determination may be an areal extent or a linear distance. Larger geoforms (Level 1) are generally larger than one square kilometer, and correspond to Megahabitats in the Greene et al. classification system (2007). These features can be defined using geologic or geomorphic maps and bathymetric images of the seafloor at map scales of 1:250,000 or less. Smaller geoforms (Level 2) are generally less than one square kilometer in size (or less than 1 kilometer in distance); and correspond to Meso-and Macro-habitats in the Greene et al. system. Level 2 geoforms (such as individual coral reefs, tide pools, and sand wave fields) can be identified through in-situ observational methods (such as underwater videography) or through low-altitude, high-resolution optical or acoustic remote sensing.
Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are arranged as two separate subcomponents so that they can be used in tandem to describe complex spatial patterns of geoform structures. Level 2 geoforms normally occur as portions of—or smaller features contained (nesting) within— Level 1 geoforms, but are not hierarchically constrained by the Level 1 geoforms. It is possible for geoforms at either level to nest within other units within their same level (for example, a Level 2 pockmark may occur within a Level 2 shoal/bar as in Figure 6.1 below). Although Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are considered different subcomponents because of their scale differences, they share the same hierarchical structure and some units are found in both levels (if they occur over a broad range of sizes). For brevity, we have combined the definitions of these units into one listing and have indicated the subcomponent(s) in which they reside.
Geoform types are varieties of geoforms that provide further information on morphology and physical processes underway at any individual geoform. Users are encouraged to apply the Type designations where applicable—but they are not required to use it if their data do not support this level of detail. Users are also encouraged to provide the full nesting (recording of upper-level attributes) for any geoforms they identify, although there will be many instances where this is not practical.",2012-06,G,g
Geoform Component,Geoform,Geologic Geoform,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Origin,"Geologic geoforms are formed by the abiotic processes of uplift, erosion, volcanism, deposition, fluid seepage, and material movement. Uplift may be a result of local and regional seismic and tectonic processes. Waves, currents, wind, chemical dissolution, seismic motion, and chemical precipitation all contribute to these geoforms and give them their distinctive qualities.",2012-06,G,g1
