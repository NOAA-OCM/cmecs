Geoform Component,,,,,CMECS Component: Geoform ,"In CMECS, the geological context—and associated features of the landscape and seascape—are captured in the Geoform Component (GC), which describes the physical structure of the environment across multiple scales. The GC addresses five aspects of the coastal and seafloor morphology: tectonic setting, physiographic setting, geoform origin, geoform, and geoform type. The framework for the GC adopts most of the structures described by Greene et al. (2007) and the estuary types outlined in Madden et al. (2008), but expands the options to include a larger number of coastal and nearshore features.
The GC is not intended to be a geological classification per se. Rather, it provides a way to present the structural aspects of the physical environment that are relevant to—and drivers of—biological community distribution. This component does not include surface geology attributes [such as hardbottom, softbottom, sand, gravel, and cobble as in Greene et al. (2007)], because these attributes are included in the Substrate Component that describes the character and composition of the seafloor. Used together, geoform and substrate component units reflect the physical environment in which benthic/attached biota occurs.
The GC is organized into four subcomponents that occur along a spatial continuum (Table 6.1): tectonic setting and physiographic setting describe large, global features, while the level 1 and level 2 geoform subcomponents describe meso-and microscale units (extending down to features at the meter scale). Each subcomponent has a general scale range associated with it, but features within these categories will naturally overlap one another—because of the natural gradients and transitions between geologic units and processes. Similarly, regional differences in processes will cause units to respond differently on spatial and temporal scales (Harris et al. 2005).","Greene, H. G., J. J. Bizzarro, V. M. O’Connell, and C. K.

Because of their depth, they tend to have low surface-area-to-volume ratios. They have moderate watershed-to-water-area ratios and low-to-moderate riverine inputs. Fjords often have a geologic sill formation at the seaward end caused by glacial action. This morphology- combined with a low exchange of bottom waters with the ocean- can result in formation of hypoxic bottom waters.",,1.1.1,G,p10,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000350,CMECS_00000350,Original Unit,,,
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Inland/Enclosed Sea,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A large, water body almost completely surrounded by land. Salinities range from fresh through marine. The term inland is used to describe situations where the water body is connected to an adjacent large water body by a narrow strait, channel, canal, or river. Examples of this type of setting are the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The Great Lakes, due to their connectivity to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River also fall into this category.",,1.1.1,G,p11,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00001484,CMECS_00001484,Original Unit,,,
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Lagoonal Estuary,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be shallow, highly enclosed, and have reduced exchange with the ocean. They often experience high evaporation, and they tend to be quiescent in terms of wind, current, and wave energy. Lagoonal estuaries usually have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, a low-to-moderate watershed-to-water-area ratio, and can have a high wetland-to-water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and embayments because the restricted exchange with the marine-end member and the reduced river input lengthen residence times. As such, there tends to be more benthic-pelagic interaction, enhanced by generally shallow bathymetry. Additionally, exchange with surrounding landscapes (often riparian wetland and palustrine systems) tends to be enhanced and more highly coupled than in other types of estuaries.

Occasionally, a lagoon may be produced by the temporary sealing of a river estuary by a barrier. Such lagoons are usually seasonal and exist until the river breaches the barrier; these lagoons occur in regions of low or sporadic rainfall.",,1.1.1,G,p12,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000455,CMECS_00000455,Original Unit,,,
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Major River Delta,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"The nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at the mouth of a river, which commonly forms a triangular or fan-shaped plain. It is crossed by many distributaries, and the delta is the result of sediment accumulation from the river. Deltas are distinguished from alluvial fans by their flatter slope. Examples of this feature include the Mississippi Delta, the Nile Delta, and the Ganges Delta. All deltas are dynamic areas of mixed-water flow and salinity.",,1.1.1,G,p13,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000488,CMECS_00000488,Original Unit,,,

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Riverine Estuary,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be linear and seasonally turbid (especially in upper reaches), and it can be subjected to high current speeds. These estuaries are sedimentary and depositional, so they may be associated with a delta, bar, barrier island, and other depositional features. These estuaries also tend to be highly flushed (with a wide and variable salinity range) and seasonally stratified. Riverine estuaries have moderate surface-to-volume ratios with a high watershed-to-water-area ratio- and they can have very high wetland-to-water-area ratios as well. These estuaries are often characterized by a V-shaped channel configuration and a salt wedge.

High inputs of land drainage can promote increased primary productivity, which may be confined to the water column in the upper reach, due to low transparency in the water column. Surrounding wetlands may be extensive and healthy, given the sediment supply and nutrient input. This marsh perimeter may be important in taking up the excess nutrients that are introduced to the system. Physically, the system may tend to be stratified during periods of high riverine input, and the input of marine waters may be enhanced by countercurrent flow.",,1.1.1,G,p16,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000682,CMECS_00000682,Original Unit,,,

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Trench,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Trenches in the physiographic setting subcomponent occur at a smaller spatial scale than the hemispheric-sized trenches in the tectonic setting.

Geoform Component,Geoform,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"Geoforms are physical, coastal and seafloor structures that are generally no larger than hundreds of square kilometers in size. This size determination may be an areal extent or a linear distance. Larger geoforms (Level 1) are generally larger than one square kilometer, and correspond to Megahabitats in the Greene et al. classification system (2007). These features can be defined using geologic or geomorphic maps and bathymetric images of the seafloor at map scales of 1:250,000 or less. Smaller geoforms (Level 2) are generally less than one square kilometer in size (or less than 1 kilometer in distance); and correspond to Meso-and Macro-habitats in the Greene et al. system. Level 2 geoforms (such as individual coral reefs, tide pools, and sand wave fields) can be identified through in-situ observational methods (such as underwater videography) or through low-altitude, high-resolution optical or acoustic remote sensing.
Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are arranged as two separate subcomponents so that they can be used in tandem to describe complex spatial patterns of geoform structures. Level 2 geoforms normally occur as portions of—or smaller features contained (nesting) within— Level 1 geoforms, but are not hierarchically constrained by the Level 1 geoforms. It is possible for geoforms at either level to nest within other units within their same level (for example, a Level 2 pockmark may occur within a Level 2 shoal/bar as in Figure 6.1 below). Although Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are considered different subcomponents because of their scale differences, they share the same hierarchical structure and some units are found in both levels (if they occur over a broad range of sizes). For brevity, we have combined the definitions of these units into one listing and have indicated the subcomponent(s) in which they reside.
Geoform types are varieties of geoforms that provide further information on morphology and physical processes underway at any individual geoform. Users are encouraged to apply the Type designations where applicable—but they are not required to use it if their data do not support this level of detail. Users are also encouraged to provide the full nesting (recording of upper-level attributes) for any geoforms they identify, although there will be many instances where this is not practical.","Greene, H.

Geoform Component,Geoform,Anthropogenic Geoform,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Origin,"In many coastal and deep oceans, artificial structures (such as piers, breakwaters, bulkheads, berms, drilling rigs, and artificial reefs) are a significant part of the environment. The continually (or intermittently) submerged portions of features attract vagile fauna and provide attachment surfaces for plants and sessile animals. These features can also provide shelter from predators and prevailing current, and they can support niche communities that increase overall biodiversity. However, these structures can also have negative effects (such as altering natural hydrodynamic patterns, interfering with animal movement, and increasing contaminant loading into nearshore areas), and thus are often of interest to resource managers.

The same relationship between Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms prevails in this origin type as in the geologic and biogenic categories; however, due to the complexity of some of the anthropogenic structures, many more Level 2 units may be present in a single Level 1 geoform. Besides physical structures, features that are the result of human activity (such as scars and trawl marks) are included among the anthropogenic geoforms.",,1.1.1,G,g3,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000015,CMECS_00000015,Original Unit,,,
