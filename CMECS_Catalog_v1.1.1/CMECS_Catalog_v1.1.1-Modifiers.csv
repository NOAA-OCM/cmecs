Modifiers,,,,CMECS Modifiers,"Modifiers are physicochemical, spatial, geological, biological, anthropogenic, and temporal variables with defined categorical values and ranges that are used to describe CMECS units. Modifiers can be applied when additional information is needed to further characterize an identified unit for individual applications. Modifiers provide additional environmental, structural, or biological information about the ecosystem; modifiers are useful for description and application- but they are not required for classification according to the CMECS schema. Modifiers are a dynamic component of the CMECS in the sense that users are free to apply additional local modifiers for their project needs as long as these are reported and do not conflict with modifiers outlined in this section.
The modifiers are organized by into general modifier types, and then listed alphabetically within the given type for easy reference. The general modifier types include Anthropogenic, Biogeographic, Biological, Physical, Physicochemical, Spatial, and Temporal.",,1.1.1,None,None,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000565,CMECS_00000565,Original Unit,,,

Modifiers,Biological Modifiers,Community Successional Stage,,CMECS Modifier," In the ecological literature, successional stage is a concept used to characterize identifiable points along a continuum of sequentialand somewhat predictablereplacements of taxa following a major disturbance which opens up a relatively large space. These stages are based in part on the differing organism life-history strategies of biota, and in part on their resulting modifications to the physical environment (Odum 1969; Ritter, Montagna, and Applebaum 2005). Rosenberg (1976) pointed out that the same basic pattern of succession is seen in soft-sediment environments in many different parts of the world, in response to various stressors (e.g., organic input, temperature stress, or low oxygen), noting that species composition (but not the basic pattern) differs among settings. Early work on infaunal marine succession recognized that this process is a complex and continually varying response to a history of disturbance, and that there is a complete spectrum in nature (Johnson 1972). Nonetheless, there is (along this spectrum) a predictable pattern to benthic community structure that follows levels of stress and disturbance, and this is a very useful construct in understanding the environment (Rosenberg 2001). CMECS provides four modifiers for Community Stage in soft-sediment areas; these have been described previously (Pearson and Rosenberg 1976, 1978; Rhoads and Germano 1982, 1986; Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) and are shown in Figure 10.1.","Odum, E.

Modifiers,Biological Modifiers,Invertebrate Community Organism Size,,CMECS Modifier,"The Invertebrate Community Organism Size modifier is intended for use in the Biotic Component, Faunal Bed Class. Ecological theory of community succession and disturbance posits that less frequently disturbed environments will provide the stability to support longer-lived communities of larger organisms, while frequently disturbed environments will be characterized by smaller and shorter-lived organisms. Faunal Bed communities are often complex, with a wide range of individual organisms and species occurring in many sizes to fill a variety of ecological niches. CMECS provides a coarse set of Organism Size Modifiers to describe Faunal Bed communities through sizes of the larger organisms that are evident in an observational unit. Many different methods have historically been proposed to distinguish macrofauna from megafaunaranging from visible to the unassisted eye, to retention on various screen sizes, to inclusion only of
much larger organisms. The CMECS criterion used to identify megafauna is a body size > 1 cm (in the smallest dimension). Importantly, this modifier describes the defining, significant, or dominant organisms that best characterize a community, recognizing that most communities include a variety of organisms that occur in both large and small individual sizes.",,1.1.1,None,ICO,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000440,CMECS_00000440,Original Unit,,,

Modifiers,Physicochemical Modifiers,Photic Quality,,CMECS Modifier,"Photic quality is a highly variable parameter. In many cases, water is clear and downwelling light penetration extends the photic zone to the bottom of the water column. In cases of reduced water clarity, light is highly attenuated. Photic exposure depends on the depth, sun angle, cloud cover, time of year, and other factors. Moreover, the depth of the shift from photic to aphotic occurs at different points in the water column, depending on the ecosystem, watershed, and suspended substances reducing water clarity.
Vertical zones are evaluated relative to the penetration of light (photic and aphotic) for both water column and benthic components. The depth of the photic zone can also be calculated from ocean color imagery using satellite algorithms (Lee et al. 2007).","Lee, Z. P., A.Weidemann, J. Kindle, R. Arnone, K. L. Carder, and C.

Modifiers,Physicochemical Modifiers,aRPD and RPD Depth,,CMECS Modifier,"The apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity (aRPD) is a measurement of the depth of the color break, that is, the maximum color difference below the sediment-water interface at which lighter-colored (tan, brown, beige, yellow, or red), more-oxidized surface sediments transition into darker-colored (grey, black, or blue-black), more-reduced deeper sediments. The depth of the aRPD is easily measured, and it has been found to be an extremely useful parameter in characterizing certain biogeochemical aspects of the sedimentary environment. For instance, the aRPD represents the depth at which iron exists as colored, insoluble, ferric hydroxides, which dissolve into solution as iron monosulfides in a reducing environment, e.g., in the presence of sulfate reduction (Teal et al. 2009).
The aRPD is strongly correlated to the true RPD depth (Grizzle and Penniman 1991; Rosenberg et al. 2001), which is the depth where Eh (measured sediment reduction/oxidation potential) is zero. Both values are very useful as proxies for bioturbation (because the values are extended deeper by the effects of bioturbating fauna), and both are correlated to bottom-water dissolved-oxygen concentration (Rosenberg 1977; Diaz, Cutter, and Rhoads 1994; Cicchetti et al. 2006). The aRPD can be measured with a variety of techniques including retrieval of cores, sediment profile imaging, and direct observation. The RPD can be measured using microelectrodes, either in retrieved cores or <in situ>.

RPD (centimeters)  The RPD is measured with electrodes, and is reported in centimeters.
aRPD depth (centimeters), muddy sediments  The aRPD depth is measured at the color transition based on direct observation or from images, and it can be reported in centimeters or following the terms defined below (from Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997).

Modifiers,Physicochemical Modifiers,Water Column Stability Regime,,CMECS Modifier,"Water column stability can be characterized as stratified, partially mixed, and well-mixed. This structure is defined by density differentials from bottom to surface, as shown in the table below. Water Column Stability is assessed using the more universally applied delta Sigma-t to calculate stability, which incorporates salinity, temperature into the calculation of density and adjusts for adiabatic effects (Pond and Pickard 1983). The Stability Regime modifier compares the calculated delta Sigma-t, or the relative density of two water parcels by subtraction of the density of the surface layer from the density of the deeper layer. If the density difference equals or exceeds 0.125, the water column is considered to be vertically stable; if it differs by less than 0.125, and density is homogeneous between the upper and lower layers, the water column is classified as well-mixed. If the density difference is less than 0.125 and variable between the two layers, the water column is classified as partially mixed.","Pond, S. and G. L. Pickard. 1983. Dynamical Oceanography.

Modifiers,Spatial Modifiers,Co-occurring Elements,Descriptive,CMECS Modifier,"Nature is inherently a mixture or a continuum. CMECS provides an ecologically meaningful methodology to classify nature into discrete environmental types using consistent threshold values that define primary classification units. However, in natural coastal and marine settings, less abundant, co-occurring (or secondary) features are frequently mixed into these primary classification types at some level beneath a classification threshold. Therefore, these co-occurring features are not recognized in the syntax of the primary classification. In some situations, project goals may require identification of these co-occurring features and associated taxa. In other situations, identification of co-occurring materials, taxa, or mixes may detract from project goals.
CMECS provides a modifier, Co-occurring Elements, for identification of secondary CMECS classification units that are mixed into a primary classification unit at a level below the classification threshold. Co-occurring Elements are used in the hierarchical Biotic and Substrate Components when the primary feature and the co-occurring feature are both units in that same Component.
