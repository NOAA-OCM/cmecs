Water Column Component,,,,,CMECS Component: Water Column ,"The Water Column Component (WC) describes the water column environment of estuaries and oceans.The water column presents unique challenges to classification and characterization—due to its three-dimensional structure; a high degree of temporal variability; a wide, dynamic range in environmental characteristics (across multiple spatial scales); and the inherent challenges of measuring the various parameters. The WC identifies the structures, patterns, properties, and processes, of the water column relevant to ecological relationships and habitat-organism interactions. This component extends from the land-sea margin to the deep oceans and vertically from the surface of the water to the benthic interface. The WC encompasses the Lacustrine, Estuarine, and Marine Systems. The water column component of the Lacustrine System will be fully addressed in a later document, while the latter two systems are described here.
Because the water column is highly variable in both time and space, it is difficult to assign structures or properties to a specific location or depth with certainty. The characteristics of the water continuously change over time. For example, in the clear waters of the open ocean, the well-lit zone of photosynthesis generally extends throughout the upper 200 meters of the water column. In estuaries and coastal waters, surface conditions and water constituents reduce the depth of the photic zone by orders of magnitude. Nearshore photic depths can be quite shallow and variable from place to place or over short time periods. In shallow waters, optical dynamics are compressed in the vertical dimension and their effects are amplified—strongly influencing biota in the water column and in the benthos.
The WC is designed to accommodate the high degree of spatio-temporal variability of the water column with a simple and flexible structure and a comprehensive array of units and modifiers. The WC provides a way to define and organize key information most commonly required to characterize the water column. Spatially, the WC can be applied to points or profiles within the water column, as well as to water masses, regions, entire water bodies and entire oceans.
The WC contains five subcomponents that can be used alone or in combination (Table 5.1): Layer, Salinity, Temperature, Hydroform and Biogeochemical Feature. The Layer subcomponent indicates vertical position within the water column, using a set of defined layers associated with each subsystem and gives information about relative proximity to the atmosphere, mid-depth or benthos. Units in the Salinity and Temperature subcomponents describe the salinity and temperature characteristics of a water parcel within standard ranges. Hydroform Classes, their hydroforms, and hydroform types describe physical hydrographic features such as currents, waves, water masses, gyres, upwellings and fronts. The Biogeochemical Features subcomponent describes such phenomena as biofilm, thermocline and turbidity maximum—features of the water column that include properties and constituents beyond simple hydrodynamics. Modifiers can be selected from a comprehensive list and applied to any component to define additional characteristics such as trophic status, oxygen status, tide regime and energy regime.",,1.1.1,W,None,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000894,CMECS_00000894,Original Unit,,,
Water Column Component,Water Column Layer ,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"The Water Column Layer Subcomponent resolves the water column vertically into its major coherent layers based on position relative to the surface and to the pycnocline or mid-depth. These layers reflect ecologically important characteristics of the water column structure. The layers for all cross-shelf waters include Surface Layer, Upper Water Column, Pycnocline and Lower Water Column. In the Marine Oceanic Subsystem, additional divisions (described below) are based on depth in the water column. The Layer subcomponent works with the Subsystem of the Aquatic Setting described in Section 4 to define the estuarine and marine water column as a grid. The grid framework is composed of horizontal regions (x-y axes) divided on the basis of position relative to land and total water depth, and vertical layers (z-axis) defined by depth below the surface. This structural arrangement provides a fixed frame of reference for describing position within the water column and accommodates the variability in water column features, conditions and movements by applying additional subcomponents (Figure 5.1).
One set of Water Column Layers is defined for application to all Estuarine Subsystems and the two Marine Subsystems (Nearshore and Offshore) in cross shelf waters where the total water depth is relatively shallow.
For all subsystems (except the Marine Oceanic) the following Water Column Layers are defined:

Surface Layer: The interface between the water column and the atmosphere, extending to a depth of several centimeters, represents the surface of maximum exchange of atmospheric gases, heat and light. Surface films, floating vegetation and aggregations of materials or biota accumulate at this interface.

Upper Water Column: The area from just below the surface to the boundary of the pycnocline, if present. (If a pycnocline is not present or is not detected, the region above mid-depth in the water column is defined as the Upper Water Column.) The upper water column layer is in close contact with the atmosphere; usually oxygenated, well-mixed and well-lighted; and is generally marked by high rates of photosynthesis and net autotrophic production.

Pycnocline: The zone of maximum change of density of a particular physicochemical variable—normally salinity or temperature—that segregates two distinct layers, which are of relatively homogeneous density. The presence of a pycnocline provides a barrier to vertical mixing between the upper and lower water columns, and this layer enhances the stability of the water column.

Lower Water Column: The area below the pycnocline (or, if absent, below mid-depth in the water column), the lower portion of the water column is often dimly or negligibly illuminated (particularly in estuaries) and can be heterotrophic. These deeper waters have limited contact with the atmosphere, may be reduced in oxygen content, and can have a high degree of interaction with bottom sediments. This layer receives organic and mineral material from upper waters and is frequently the site of anoxia. In estuaries, the salt wedge and counter current flow occur in this layer.",,1.1.1,W,l,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000895,CMECS_00000895,Original Unit,,,

Water Column Component,Salinity Regime,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"Salinity in seawater results from a concentration of salts including bromine, iodine, and (principally) sodium chloride. Salinity is measured as a dimensionless conductivity ratio on the practical salinity scale (PSS), which was established by the IAPSO (International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans) in 1978 (UNESCO 1981). Most marine waters have salinities between 34 and 35, while in estuaries and coastal waters salinity can vary considerably from zero to hyperhaline (greater than or equal to 40). In estuaries, the salinity distribution is a function of direct precipitation, the influx of freshwater supplied by rivers, groundwater sources and runoff from the land and marine water supplied by exchange with the ocean as a function of tidal regime. Salinity is an indicator of the dynamic or conservative nature of mixing within the water body, and is one of the defining features of the structure of coastal waters. Most aquatic organisms function optimally within a narrow range of salinities, which has impact on the ecological balance and trophic structure of communities. Salinity categories and ranges for CMECS are provided in Table 5.2.","UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). 1981. “The Practical Salinity Scale 1978 and he International Equation of State of Seawater 1980.” Appendix I, Tenth Report of the Joint Panel on Oceanographic Tables and Standards.

Water Column Component,Temperature Regime,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy, and in most cases decreases with depth in the water column. The mean temperature of oceanic seawater, which by volume is principally at depth, is generally low, 0 – 5o C, but higher in the water column temperatures tend to converge toward air temperature at the surface. Marine waters are structured vertically with a mixed surface layer having little gradient in temperature, a thermocline with a highly variable gradient, and underlying waters with little stratification. A thermocline is established between an upper layer of one temperature and a lower layer of another and can be seasonal or permanent depending on the circulation and weather patterns. Pronounced thermoclines occur in the tropics, and essentially none occur in Polar Regions. In estuaries, temperatures are more variable because waters are shallower and under more influence of the temperature of inflowing freshwaters or of tidal marine waters. Temperature has a considerable impact on ecosystem functioning, affecting photosynthesis, growth, metabolism, and mobility of organisms. Rates of microbial processes of decomposition, nitrogen fixation and denitrification generally double with each increase of 10o C. Organisms tolerate a particular temperature range, and the temperature optimum range may span only a few degrees. The solubility of gases and pH are dependent on temperature, and temperature influences the ability of water to hold oxygen or oxic status.
Temperature categories are established in intervals of sufficient range and resolution to provide meaningful ecological differences yet yield a parsimonious number of categories. Temperature categories are based on the British Columbia Marine Ecological Classification for Canada (Howes, Harper, and Owens 1994, Zacharias et al. 1998, Resource Information Standards Committee 2002), modified to add the higher temperature ranges typical of the subtropics and tropics.

Water Column Component,Hydroform,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"Hydroforms are physical entities that have a coherent, definable structure with identifiable boundaries and characteristic physical properties. The Hydroform Subcomponent is a hierarchy of three levels consisting of Hydroform Classes, Hydroforms and Hydroform Types. Hydroforms are ecologically important because they shape their environment by creating gradients, surfaces, barriers, compartments and energy vectors. They strongly influence the distribution and condition of biota and often act as habitat by creating a complex environmental structure, by facilitating and enhancing transport of materials and energy, cycling nutrients, providing refugia, aggregating food resources, and providing migration paths. They influence the transfer of heat, salts, oxygen, carbon dioxide, trace elements, momentum, predicted trajectory, temporal persistence and associated fauna. Hydroforms vary extensively in size, volume, areal extent, persistence, and ecological significance.
In this standard hydroforms are represented conceptually as the average expression of their defining characteristics. The boundaries of the hydroforms are to be determined by methodology, technology limits, user objectives and application and lie along a continuum. Implementation guidance will be developed to assist in determining quantitative cutoffs that define their boundaries.",,1.1.1,W,h,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000423,CMECS_00000423,Original Unit,,,
Water Column Component,Hydroform,Current,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent: Hydroform  ,"Water that is undergoing coherent mass movement, either as laminar or turbulent flow, relative to surrounding waters and fixed structural, landform or geologic features. A directional, coherently flowing water mass. Currents operate on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales from huge ocean gyres and major surface and deep-water currents of the ocean operating on annual timescales to tidal currents that operate on sub daily timescales. However, all currents have features in common: the advective movement and transport of water, constituents (such as particulates and dissolved compounds), qualities (such as temperature and salinity) and biota (such as plankton, nekton, and megafauna).
