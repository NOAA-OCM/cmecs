Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting System,"The Estuarine System is defined by salinity and geomorphology. This System includes tidally influenced waters that (a) have an open-surface connection to the sea, (b) are regularly diluted by freshwater runoff from land, and (c) exhibit some degree of land enclosure. The Estuarine System extends upstream to the head of tide and seaward to the mouth of the estuary. Head of tide is identified in accordance with the Metadata Profile for Shoreline Data, FGDC-STD-001.2-2001 (FGDC 2001) as the inland or upstream limit of water affected by a tide of at least 0.2 foot (0.06 meter) amplitude. The mouth of the estuary is defined by an imaginary line connecting the seaward-most points of land that enclose the estuarine water mass at MLLW. Islands are included as headlands if they contribute significantly to the enclosure. Estuaries occur on continents or on islands and include waters of any depth. In CMECS they are defined as waters bounded by significant enclosure by land, having a direct connection to the sea and receiving measurable freshwater input to some part of the enclosed system during an average year. Salinity, a dimensionless conductivity ratio as measured on the practical salinity scale (PSS), was established by the IAPSO (International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans) in 1978 (UNESCO 1981), and is of prime importance in distinguishing freshwater from saline estuarine environments and differentiating among estuarine and marine environments of differing salinity. The range of salinity considered in the CMECS classification extends from zero to hyperhaline (>40). Oceanic salinities normally encountered throughout the world range from 30-40 on the PSS scale. Highly saline negative estuaries such as Laguna Madre and Florida Bay may experience salinity as high as 70-80. Extreme environments like the Dead Sea have salinity near 300. The tidally influenced part of the estuary may occur in a fresh reach where salinity is <0.5. According to FGDC-STD-004, this area would be classified within the Riverine System. However in CMECS, the Tidal Riverine area is considered to be an integral part of the ecology of the estuarine ecosystem, so it is classified within the Estuarine System instead.

The Estuarine System has four subsystems: Coastal, Open Water, Tidal Riverine Coastal, and Tidal Riverine Open Water.","FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee). 2001. FGDC-STD-001.2-2001.

Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Coastal Subsystem,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Coastal Subsystem extends from the supratidal zone at the land margin up to the 4 meter depth contour in waters that have salinity greater than 0.5 (during the period of average annual low flow). The Estuarine Coastal Subsystem would be considered the shallow perimeter in a deeper estuary, although many estuaries may be entirely less than 4 meters deep and be classified as completely in the Coastal Subsystem. The 4 meter contour was selected as a cutoff between ""coastal"" and ""offshore"" estuarine waters because it identifies (somewhat arbitrarily) a region that is both shallow and generally in close proximity to the shore, making the substrate-to-water volume ratio here the highest in the entire estuary. A convening of experts delineated this 4 meter contour as described in Reilly, Spagnolo, and Ambrogio (1999) as important in both an ecological and a regulatory sense in estuarine systems and CMECS has adopted it to emphasize the significant human and natural processes that occur there. The high wetland-water ration and pelagic-benthic connectivity makes the Estuarine Coastal Subsystem an extremely dynamic and active area in terms of hydrodynamics, geology, and biology. It is this area in shallow coastal waters where maximum interaction between estuarine waters, and adjacent wetlands or developed shoreline occurs and often where intense juxtaposition of human activity and the natural system occurs. Watershed, point and non-point inputs to the estuary are often maximal in this shallow zone. Because the Coastal Subsystem tends to receive an abundance of light, these waters and bottom areas are usually sites of high primary production. In water columns, shallow waters typically support high phytoplankton productivity while shallow water bottoms are covered in highly productive microphytobenthos, macroalgae and/or rooted macrophytes and their attached epiphytic communities. As regions of high primary production, shallow waters attract an abundance of higher trophic level organisms that feed on plants and on their grazer communities. Strong physical subsidies from flowing waters and wind stresses create waves and currents that generally maintain the shallow waters in a well-oxidized state. Surface waters of the Coastal Subsystem tend to be well-mixed and are affected by strong physical processes that impact the bottom: resuspending sediments, reducing light and altering spectral characteristics of the light climate. The estuarine bottom in shallow waters is also subject to frequent wind-induced reworking and transport of sediments and dynamic bedforms.","Reilly, F., Jr., R. Spagnolo, and E.

Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Open Water Subsystem,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Open Water Subsystem includes all waters of the Estuarine System with a total depth greater than 4 meters, exclusive of those waters designated Tidal Riverine Open Water. The Open Water Subsystem is subject to a number of physical factors that make it distinct from the Coastal Subsystem, including reduced air-water exchange, potentially reduced light at depth, reduced physical impact from waves and surface currents and reduced interaction between the water column and the bottom. Moreover, because of the formation of stratified layers in the Estuarine System, the Open Water Subsystem is often ""capped"" by a relatively strong density or stability gradient that distinctly separates the lower water column from the upper water column, separated by a zone of transition (such as a pycnocline, halocline, or thermocline). The Open Water Subsystem may be heterotrophic, because it often acts as a receiving basin for organic material settling from the shallower, better lit surface waters, especially when the waters are stratified and form shallow flanks of the water body. At times, this role as a heterotrophic zone may support high rates of respiration (relative to production) and therefore consume much of the available oxygen and lead to the formation of hypoxic or anoxic zones, generally in the deeper parts of these waters. Additionally, stratification and the mechanics of estuarine circulation often promote the formation of a salt wedge intrusion (from the marine environment) that renders the bottom waters more saline than waters in the surface layer above.",,1.1.1,A,2.2,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000307,CMECS_00000307,Original Unit,,,

Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem includes the most upstream region of the estuary, in those areas between MHHW to the 4 meter depth contour below MLLW in waters that (a) can be regularly influenced by tides and (b) where salinity is below 0.5 during the period of annual low flow. The areas with this salinity may extend upriver to the head of tide, which is identified as the point where the mean tidal range becomes less than 0.2 feet (0.06 meters) (FGDC 2001). The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem includes upstream areas that are influenced by ocean tides, but do not experience significant salinity. The hydraulic gradient is low and water stage and velocity fluctuate under tidal influence. Water is always present and is confined within a channel, and is usually flowing. The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem is a critical part of the ecology and habitat of the estuary. This area is the site of significant ecological activity and a number of estuarine and coastal species depend on Tidal Riverine Coastal areas for breeding habitats, nursery habitats, and migratory pathways (e.g., striped bass, wading birds, and anadromous fishes). The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem also supports unique hydrological features, for example the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum, tidal bores and Coriolis deflections.","FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee). 2001.

Similar to the Estuarine Open Water Subsystem, physical impact from waves and surface currents is reduced interaction at depth. This zone may be the site of the upper limit of the salt wedge and of a turbidity maximum zone, important as feeding and aggregation sites for plankton and benthic species. This zone is also potentially subject to high organic loading and formation of hypoxic waters.

Aquatic Setting,Marine System,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting System,"The Marine System is defined by salinity, which is typically about 35, although salinity can measure as low as 0.5 during the period of average annual low flow near fresh outflows. This system has little or no significant dilution from fresh water except near the mouths of estuaries and rivers. The Marine System includes all non-estuarine waters from the coastline to the central oceans. The landward boundary of this system is either the linear boundary across the mouth of an estuary or the limit of the supratidal splash zone affected by breaking waves. Seaward, the Marine System includes all ocean waters. The Marine System is typified by waves, currents and coastal water regimes determined by oceanic tides. Coastal indentations and bays that do not receive appreciable and regular freshwater inflow are part of the Marine System. Areas where river plumes discharge directly into marine waters without geomorphological enclosure are also part of the Marine System. In such areas, (e.g., Mississippi River plume, Chesapeake Bay plume), low salinity water and fresh plumes may discharge from the seaward boundary of the estuary, extending far into the Marine System beyond the enclosed part of the estuary. These freshwater features are considered to be Hydroforms within the Marine System (see Section 5).

Aquatic Setting,Marine System,Marine Nearshore Subsystem,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Marine Nearshore Subsystem extends from the landward limit of the Marine System to the 30 meter depth contour. The 30 meter depth contour was selected as a useful cutoff between shallower nearshore and deeper offshore waters. It is intended to represent an ecologically significant depth to which water column and benthic processes are strongly coupled in the Nearshore Subsystem. Surface currents and waves impinge the bottom at the storm wave base (Keen and Holland 2010) and vertical circulation generally distributes nutrients and sediments throughout the water column. The photic zone extends through the entire water column except in extreme cases (Kleypas, McManus and Menez 1999). The presence of nutrients and light support the growth of vegetation on the bottom including seagrass and macroalgal beds and 30 meters generally represents the depth to which most living coral is found.","Keen, T.

This shelf break boundary generally occurs between 100 - 200 meters depth. In the case of steep-sided, oceanic islands, where a continental shelf is not present, the offshore boundary of the Offshore Subsystem is defined at a bottom slope discontinuity occurring between 100 - 200 meters, or at 200 meters if no such discontinuity exists. The waters and benthos of the Offshore Subsystem are less coupled to each other and typically less influenced by terrigenous processes than in the Nearshore Subsystem. Distance from shore can vary greatly, depending on shelf morphology, and waters at the 30 meter isobath can be quite distant from the shore or may lie relatively close to land. The Offshore Subsystem may be strongly influenced by open-ocean biogeochemistry and physical processes. Often distinct water layers at the surface and bottom may be present. Because Offshore Subsystem waters are less influenced by coastal inputs, they generally are less turbid than those of the Nearshore Subsystem.

Aquatic Setting,Marine System,Marine Oceanic Subsystem,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Marine Oceanic Subsystem represents the open ocean, extending from the continental shelf break to the deep ocean. Oceanic waters typically have salinity levels of greater than or equal to 36. Water depths typically range from 100 -200 meters at their shallowest at the shelf break to over 11,000 meters at the deepest point in the ocean.
The great depth of the Oceanic Subsystem is responsible for many of its characteristics. The oceanic water column tends to be more stable physicochemically; undergoing changes in temperature and salinity relatively slowly. Greater depth also diminishes the influence of the sea bottom on the overlying water column. Surface and bottom processes generally are poorly coupled and separated by great distances and thermocline layers. The waters of the Oceanic Subsystem receive little direct terrigenous input; the inputs from land typically occur indirectly, after passage through the substantial coastal water masses or atmospheric deposition.
Conditions in the Oceanic Subsystem are a function of the properties of the water column. For example, light penetration diminishes with depth (as sea water absorbs component wavelengths); thus, the quality and intensity of ambient light changes with depth. Little surface light penetrates below the photic zone (~200 meters). At greater depths, light is limited to that produced locally by bioluminescence. Water pressure also increases directly with depth because of the weight of the overlying water column, and water temperatures diminish with depth.",,1.1.1,A,3.3,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000603,CMECS_00000603,Original Unit,,,
