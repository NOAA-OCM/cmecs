Obsolete,Geologic Substrate,Unconsolidated Mineral Substrate,,,,CMECS Substrate Component: Substrate Class,"Geologic Substrates with less than 50% cover of Rock Substrate. This class uses Folk (1954) terminology to describe any mix of loose mineral substrate that occurs at any range of sizes—from Boulders to Clay. This hierarchy and the associated terms are shown in Figure 7.2. These classifications may be based on percent weight (e.g., for retrieved samples); percent cover (e.g., for plan-view images); or visual percent composition (for other approaches). Units with bracketed letters, e.g., [G], [mSG], correspond to the labeled polygons in Figure 7.2, using conventions from Folk (1954).","Folk, R.L., 1954. “The Distinction between Grain Size and Mineral Composition in Sedimentary-Rock Nomenclature.” The Journal of Geology 62: 344-359.",1.1.1,S,1.2,https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000867,CMECS_00000867,Deprecated Unit,,,
