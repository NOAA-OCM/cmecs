# CMECS Biotic Component

- _Biotic Group: Attached Tube-Building Fauna_ was erroneously ommitted from the original CMECS Codeset so it was not assigned a Unit Code at that time. Therefore, and the subordinate units under Attached Tube-Building Fauna were erroneously categorized under _Biotic Group: Diverse Colonizers_. New Unit Codes were assigned as follows: to _Biotic Group: Attached Tube-Building Fauna_ (https://w3id.org/CMECS/CMECS_00000067) and its subordinate Biotic Communities.
  - _Biotic Group: Attached Tube-Building Fauna_- unit code change from 2.2.1.3.4 to 2.2.1.24 in the csv and xlxs tables only. There was no unit code in the cmecs.owl file so the correct code has now been added. 
    - _Biotic Community: Attached Phoronids_- new Unit Code is 2.2.1.24.1. Changed in the v1.1.0 cmecs.owl file, added to the csv and xlxs tables
    - _Biotic Community: Attached Pogonophorans_- Unit Code changed from 2.2.1.3.5 to 2.2.1.24.2. Changed in cmecs.owl file and the csv and xlxs tables
    - _Biotic Community: Attached Sabellaria_- Unit Code change from 2.2.1.3.6 to 2.2.1.24.3. Change in cmecs.owl file and the csv and xlxs tables
    - _Biotic Community: Attached Serpula_- Unit Code change from 2.2.1.3.7 to 2.2.1.24.4. Change in cmecs.owl file and the csv and xlxs tables
    - _Biotic Community: Attached Serpulorbis_- Unit Code change from 2.2.1.3.8 to 2.2.1.24.5. Change in cmecs.owl file and the csv and xlxs tables

# CMECS Substrate Component (SC) Changes
Please note that v1.1.1 includes changes to unit attributes _**ONLY**_ and _**DOES NOT**_ include any changes to CMECS units (i.e., concept changes). The _**CMECS Thesaurus**_ is therefore unchanged from the last release. The most recent version of the _**CMECS Thesaurus**_ (browsable text output of the CMECS Catalog ecological units and implementation guidance) is still:
- [CMECS_Thesaurus_v1.1.0.pdf](CMECS_Thesaurus_v1.1.0.pdf)
- [CMECS_Thesaurus_v1.1.0.md](CMECS_Thesaurus_v1.1.0.md)

#### Unit Attribute Changes and Additions
Changes adopted to the Substrate Component in v1.1.0 required the assignment of new Unit Codes for most SC units.
